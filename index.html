        <p class="subtitle">a structural equation modelling applications discussion group</p>
        <h2><img src="logo.png" alt="SEMantics logo" width=25%></h2>
        <p>SEMantics is a discussion group and seminar series about all things
        structural equation modelling (SEM). We meet monthly to discuss:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SEM applications for answering hypotheses in psychology, psychiatry, social
                science and epidemiology</li>
            <li>SEM methodological advantages and challenges</li>
            <li>Recent developments, innovations, and new techniques</li>
            <li>Best practice (and cautionary tales)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>SEM is a powerful technique for answering complex research questions
        involving <b>multivariable</b>, <b>multiple regression equations</b>.
        This might include questions about <b>mediation</b>, <b>moderation</b>,
        identifying unobserved <b>latent classes</b> in our data, and exploring
        <b>longitudinal relationships</b>. These types of questions can be
        answered within the SEM framework â€” offering a flexible and powerful
        framework for understanding our data. Once mostly the preserve of the
        Mplus program, options such as <var>lavaan</var> in R and
        <var>gsem</var> in Stata are increasingly making us spoilt for software
        choice.</p>


        <p>SEMantics brings together like-minded researchers using SEM to
        answer research questions of interest. The group aims to
        <b>share knowledge</b>, provide <b>peer support</b>, and enable
        <b>networking</b> on topics related to SEM. Attendees should have at
        least a basic understanding and preferably some experience of using
        SEM. Over time, we hope for all attendees to deliver an informal
        presentation, which could be about ongoing research, software, or
        discussion of a published paper.</p>
